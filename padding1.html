<p class="white"> Hyderabad is the capital of southern India's Telangana state. A major center for the technology industry, 
it's home to many upscale restaurants and shops. Its historic sites include Golconda Fort, a former diamond-trading center that 
was once the Qutb Shahi dynastic capital. The Charminar, a 16th-century mosque whose 4 arches support towering minarets, is an old 
city landmark near the long-standing Laad Bazaar</p>
