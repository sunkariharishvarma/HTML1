<p > Hyderabad is the capital of southern India's Telangana state. A major center for the technology industry, it's home to many upscale
 restaurants and shops. Its historic sites include Golconda Fort, a former diamond-trading center that was once the Qutb Shahi dynastic
 capital. The Charminar, a 16th-century mosque whose 4 arches support towering minarets, is an old city landmark near the long-standing 
Laad Bazaar</p>
